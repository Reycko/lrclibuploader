I'm my only savior
Blood of different flavors
Fillets of connective tissue
Life is so expensive
Gluttons are the issue
I rant as my sane-ness wavers.

"You're sick inside the head."
Thank god that's what you said
Thank god (thank god)
Thank god (thank god)
Thank god that god is dead
"Is that a fucking spleen?"
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm not the type to share
I'm not the type to share

Hearts taste funny, It's unironic
Brains taste funny, I've nearly lost it
Eyes are pretty salty but it's all exotic
I'm not the type to waste.

I-I-I
I'm my only savior
Blood of different flavors
Fillets of connective tissue
Life is so expensive
Gluttons are the issue
I rant as my sane-ness wavers.

People are always free
It's bad for you but good for me
Raw and cooked and still alive
I used to starve but now I thrive
